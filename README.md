This project is cloned from a template repo **Python Bottle Skeleton** (Many thanks for it). Below is README from it.
------------------------------------

This is a skeleton web application using the bottle framework.

While bottle is an extremely simple framework, there are many things that you
probably will need to figure out if developing even fairly simple websites
using it.  This provides many examples to get you started quickly with bottle.

It includes examples of things you need to create a web application
using bottle:

  * Form processing.

  * SQLAlchemy for Database.

  * Testing.

  * WSGI interface to Apache and standalone test server.

  * Templating including standard site page template.

It does **not** include user session handling, as that varies widely by
application.

Quickstart Bottle Tutorial
--------------------------

If you just want to understand Bottle, this is probably a pretty good
choice.  It is as simple as possible, while also covering **all** the
things you are likely need to build a (fairly) complex Bottle-powered site.

To use this as a tutorial:

  * View and run `simple-example`.  This is a small program with a single
    dynamic page using the date and time via a template.

  * Optional, requires SQLAlchemy and wtforms to be installed:

    * Install python-sqlalchemy python-sqlalchemy-ext python-wtforms

    * Run: `DBCREDENTIALSTR=sqlite:///:memory: PYTHONPATH=lib python app-controller test-server`

    * In your browser go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ and click around the site
      to understand what it does.

  * Look at the code in `website.py`, particularly the sections marked by
    "XXX" .

  * Look at the tests in `tests/test_web.py` to see how tests can be
    performed against the web application.

  * Review `model.py` to see how to define a database with "SQLAlchemy
    declarative".  Particularly review the sections marked with "XXX".

  * Look at the tests in `tests/test_model.py` for examples of testing the
    database model.

  * Review `app-controller.py` if you want to understand how the site
    integrates with WSGI servers, CGI servers, or the standalone test
    server.

Quickstart Building Your Own Site
---------------------------------

If you would like to use this skeleton to create a website, which is why I
initially created this git repository:

  * If you are going to be using a database, you will need the following files:

    * `model.py` is the database model.  Copy it and modify the sections
      marked with "XXX".

    * `tests/test_model.py` has tests of the model, you will need to
      modify it to test your model, then you can run it to make sure your
      model is as you expect.

  * If you are **not** going to be using a database:

    * Delete `model.py`, `tests/test_model.py`, and `lib/bottledbwrap.py`.

    * In `website.py` remove the "dbwrap" line.

  * Modify `website.py` to customize your routes, page processing code,
    and form validation and processing.

  * Modify and create HTML template files in the `views` subdirectory.

  * Run `make` to test the code.

  * Run: `DBCREDENTIALSTR=sqlite:///:memory: python app-controller.py test-server`

  * Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ to test your application.

  * Deploy it using either the CGI or WSGI methods (discussed below).

Setting Up Apache
-----------------

  * Install mod\_wsgi and Apache (Ubuntu:`sudo apt-get install
    libapache2-mod-wsgi`).

  * Rename "conf/application.conf", update places where it has "XXX", and put
    it on your Apache config directory ("/etc/apache2/sites-enabled",
    "/etc/httpd/conf.d").

To run tests:

  * Run "make" in the top-level directory.

Structure of Project
--------------------

There are the following components to the project:

  * `simple-example.py`: This is the simplest example, a small stand-alone
    program.

  * `app-controller.py`: This is a both a WSGI app and a shell script.  It can
    be used as your WSGI application, but it also can be run with:

      * "test-server" to start a stand-alone server.

      * "initdb" to load your base database schema,

      * "load-test-data" to to populate any test data you have defined in your
        model.

  * `model.py`: Your database model definition, via SQLAlchemy.

  * `website.py`: The website controller code.  This is where most of the site
    programming happens, this includes the URL routing, form processing, and
    other code for the site.

  * `static`: Any files put in here are served as static content, such as your
    favicon.  You need to define routes to these static files in `website.py`

  * `views`: These are your website pages.  There is a site template in
    `layout.html`, and an example of form processing in `user-new.html`.

  * `lib`: Library files used by the site.

    * `bottle.py`: This is a version of bottle that I used to develop this
      skeleton, mostly as a "batteries included" move.  You may want to pick
      up a newer copy, but this skeleton is tested against the version here.

    * `bottledbwrap.py`: See below in the "About bottledbwrap" section.

  * `tests`: Tests of the web application code, hitting it through the
    routed URLs in "website.py".  Other code tests can be done in the normal
    way, see [my python-unittest-skeleton
    project](https://github.com/linsomniac/python-unittest-skeleton) for more
    code testing examples.

  * `conf/application.conf`: An Apache config file for serving the
    application.

About bottledbwrap
------------------

This is a library I've developed over the years for some of my database
applications.  It's mostly a thin layer on top of SQLAlchemy that can
pull database credentials from one of several files, or some environment
variables.

Largely it's about storing database credentials outside of your project, so
they don't get checked in to your version control or published on github.

You can provide database credentials in the following ways:

  * In a file called "dbcredentials" in the current directory or the "conf"
    sub-directory.

  * In the file specified by the environment variable "DBCREDENTIALS".

  * Directly in the environment variable "DBCREDENTIALSSTR".
